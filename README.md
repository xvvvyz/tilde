# Tilde

Inspired by [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)&mdash;the idea
is to have a browser homepage that is functional and sexy.

## Basic Usage

To go to a site, type the corresponding key and press return. For example:

- `t` will redirect you to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/home).
- `p` will redirect you to [producthunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com).

### Searching

To search a site, type a single quote after the site&rsquo;s key followed by
your query. For example:

- `g'tilde` will [search GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
- `y'kittens` will
  [search YouTube for kittens](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kittens).

If your input doesn&rsquo;t match a key, a DuckDuckGo search will be triggered.

### Specific Paths

To go to a specific path on a site, type the path after the site&rsquo;s key.
For example:

- `r/r/startpages` will redirect you to
  [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages).
- `h/popular` will redirect you to
  [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular).

### Beyond

This is how you can use Tilde out of the box, but it&rsquo;s meant to be
customized. [Make it yours!](index.html)
