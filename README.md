# Tilde

Inspired by [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)—the idea is to have a homepage for your browser that is functional and sexy.

## Usage

To go to a site, enter the corresponding key. To view the available sites and their keys, press `enter`. If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic Google search will be triggered. For example:

* Entering `t` would redirect you to [twitter.com](https://twitter.com).
* Entering `r` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com).
* Entering `cats` would search [Google for cats](https://www.google.com/search?q=cats).

### Searching

You can search any of the sites by typing a colon after the site's key, followed by your search query. For example:

* Entering `w: unix` would search [Wikipedia for unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).
* Entering `s: smash mouth` would search [SoundCloud for smash mouth](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=smash%20mouth).

### Specific Locations

You can go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the site's key, followed by the location on the site you'd like to be redirected to. For example:

* Entering `r/r/unixporn` would redirect you to [www.reddit.com/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)
* Entering `u/new` would redirect you to [unsplash.com/new](https://unsplash.com/new).

### URL Redirects

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or URL. For example:

* Entering `stallman.org` would redirect you to [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/).
* Entering `https://www.amazon.com` would redirect you to [www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/).

## Configuration

There's a shlew of options that you can configure. Just open up the `index.html` file and read through them!
